# Getting Set up with MATLAB

In order to use MATLAB, you must have a license. For students, this may be acquired through your institution. If your institution does not offer a campus-wide MATLAB license, signing up for one with your university email will offer you a student discount until your graduation date.   
   
If neither of these are accessible, you can also take advantage of a 30-day free trial (which, of course, will expire). Octave, a similar alternative to MATLAB, is free and open-source, but with some deficiencies and variations in syntax.   

To purchase a MATLAB license, visit [https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html] and click Get MATLAB. From there, you will be prompted to create or log in to an existing account.   
   
Once you have an account, you can either click the Open MATLAB Online or Install MATLAB buttons. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be downloading MATLAB to our machine. When you click the Install MATLAB button, you will be taken to a screen which automatically detects your OS and suggests the appropriate MATLAB download. Follow the instructions necessary for your OS.    

After you have downloaded MATLAB, you can open the the MATLAB IDE by simply clicking the application icon in your Applications folder (or wherever you have chosen to download it).
