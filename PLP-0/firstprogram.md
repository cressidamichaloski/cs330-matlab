### Hello, World! Your first program in MATLAB

Open the MATLAB IDE. You should see a GUI with three windows. On the left, a Current Folder window. On the right, a Workspace window. And, in the middle, a Workspace window.   

Click inside the Workspace window. You should see a shell, shown by ">>". Using command line tools, change (or make) directories to the location where you want your file to be.   

Next, click the New button on the top left of the GUI, and then select Script. This will create a new .m file, which will store your MATLAB program.   

Now, type in the .m file:    
fprintf("Hello, world!")
