# Hello, World! Your First Program in MATLAB

If you do not already have MATLAB on your device, open the setup.md file and follow those instructions to install and gain access to MATLAB.

Open the MATLAB IDE. You should see a GUI with three windows. On the left, a Current Folder window. On the right, a Workspace window. And, in the middle, a Workspace window.   

Click inside the Workspace window. You should see a shell, shown by ">>". Using command line tools, change (or make) directories to the location where you want your file to be.   

Next, click the New button on the top left of the GUI, and then select Script. This will create a new .m file, which will store your MATLAB program.   

Now, type in the .m file:    
fprintf("Hello, world!"\n)   

You can add comments using "%".

Next, click the Save button. You should be prompted to name your file. Pick a good name (probably not blacktail.m, after Nanette's dead cat. #RIP). I named my file helloWorld.m!   

Next, click the Run button on the top right of the GUI, or type >>run [filename.m] in the Command Window. Congrats! You've now created your first program in MATLAB!
