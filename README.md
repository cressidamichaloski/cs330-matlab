Learning MATLAB in CS330 - Structure and Organization of Programming Languages.

### Introduction and History
MATLAB is a programming language commonly used for signal processing, image processing, machine learning, control systems, and robotics.
   
MATLAB (portmanteau of matrix and laboratory) was originally developed by Cleve Moler during the 1970's not as a language, but as a matrix calculator. At the time, it only comprised 71 reserved words and built-in functions, all written in Fortran. MATLAB's primary purpose was to allow for easier access to existing subroutines from the LINPACK and EISPACK libraries. It was expected to serve as a classroom aide for courses ranging from introductory linear algebra to numerical analysis and interdisciplinary applications.   

In 1983, Jack Little, a member of the graduate engineering program at Stanford, left his position to reprogram MATLAB for use on the newly-released IBM PC. This new version of MATLAB was written in C by both Little and his colleague, Steve Bangert. Little and Bangert's code replaced both Moler's original Fortran code and the existing LINPACK and EISPACK code.    
Moler, Little, and Bangert went on to found MathWorks, and they introduced PC-MATLAB in 1984 at the 23rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control.   

Since then, MATLAB has evolved to become a high-level language with many data types and extended capabilities, with over 60 Toolboxes available for use.
